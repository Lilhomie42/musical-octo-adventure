## Description

As AN student I WANT to program password generator for the user with various types of variables simulating as an employee with sensitive data to strengthen user's sercurity.

Evertime the user click the button to generate a password he didn't get a reaction from the browser. The problem was there wasn't a function call on when user clicked the button. To solve this issue create a function prompting the user how long their password should be ranging from 8-128. Aslo prompt user to confirm or not to include certain types of variables. Giving the user to select(confirm) if they would like to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters, occuring to user input it would generate and display password in textarea.
